# Binary Love: 1 or 1?
_A Valentine’s Day Website That Won’t Take "No" for an Answer_

## About This Project
Binary Love is an interactive web experience built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to make saying “No” impossible.

- Implemented using JavaScript event listeners, the button dynamically shakes and triggers visual elements when hovered.
- Hovering over "No" spawns animated evil face emojis using DOM manipulation and CSS keyframe animations.
- Clicking "Yes" triggers confetti animations and background music using external libraries.
- Fully deployed via GitHub Pages, requiring no backend, making it accessible on any browser.

This project leverages event-driven programming, DOM manipulation, and CSS animations to create an engaging, gamified user experience.

## How It Works
1. The user is asked: **"Will you be my Valentine?"**
2. **Clicking "Yes"**:
   - 🎊 Confetti explodes
   - 🎵 Background music starts
   - ✅ Love is confirmed
3. **Hovering over "No"**:
   - 🫨 It shakes like it’s scared
   - 😈 Evil face emojis pop up
   - ❌ You still can't click it
4. Eventually, you’ll accept your fate and hit **Yes**.

⚠️ **Click "No" at your own risk.**

## How to Run Locally
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheDataDesk/Binary-Love.git
cd Binary-Love
```

Open index.html in a browser.
Try escaping... (you can't).

## Why This Exists
- Because a UI that gaslights you into saying "Yes" is peak engineering.
- Because if buttons can commit to CSS animations, so can you.
- Because Valentine’s Day is basically an A/B test for romance, some get a "Yes," others get sent to the control group
- Valentine’s Day is the perfect excuse to build an site that won’t let you stay single

If you enjoyed this project, star the repo, share it, or prank your crush with it.
And remember: In Binary Love, the only options are 1 or 1.
